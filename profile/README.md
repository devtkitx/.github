# 👋 Welcome to Devkitx

## 🔧 What is Devkitx?

Devkitx provides a family of small, focused CLI utilities that are:

- **Easy to install and use** — Each tool is standalone with a dedicated repository.
- **PowerShell-first** — Designed primarily for Windows PowerShell but extensible.
- **Open source & community-driven** — Contributions and feedback are welcome.
- **Extensible & modular** — Build your toolkit by picking only the tools you need.
